LISFLOOD-FP has been developed at the University of Bristol. To obtain a version of the softwater, we submitted a request to Paul Bates (Paul.Bates@bristol.ac.uk) <br />
LISFLOOD-FP is open source and can be accessed through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4073011 or https://www.seamlesswave.com/

**We run lisflood.exe to estimate flood extent and depth in Selinsgrove, PA** <br />
**Sample_Selinsgrove.par is the preliminary parameters file updated for each model run** <br />
**Sample_Selinsgrove.river is the preliminary river data file updated for each model run**
